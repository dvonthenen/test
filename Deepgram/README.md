# Getting an API Key

🔑 To access the Deepgram API you will need a [free Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

# Documentation

Complete documentation of the .NET SDK can be found on the
[Deepgram Docs](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/dotnet-sdk).

You can learn more about the full Deepgram API at [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com).

# Installation

To install the C# SDK using NuGet:

Run the following command from your terminal in your projects directory:

```csharp
dotnet add package Deepgram
```

Or use the Nuget package Manager.

Right click on project and select manage nuget packages

# Targeted Frameworks

- 8.0.x
- 7.0.x
- 6.0.x
- NetStandard2.0


#### Notes Regarding CORS
    deepgram api does not support COR requests


### Examples

### HttpClient Timeout
Timeout can be set on calling the various RestClients SpecifyTimeOut passing in a Timespan

default Timout is set to 5 minutes. 
In general the default timeout will be all that you need. However, when using the prerecorded client
to Transcibe you may find out that sending longer file to transcribe or choosing more Transcription options
will increase the time it take to transcibe your content, in there cases you can either change the HttpClientsTimeout
or use one of the Callback approaches if you dont want to be waiting around for the response.

# Creating a Client
The Sdk is configure to support Dependency injection. But you can also creat client with new()

## Create client with new()
To create rest clients to communitcate with the deepgram apis, instantiate them directly.
y

## Default Client Creation
```csharp
   
var manageClient = new ManageClient(apikey,deepgramClientOptions);
    or
    var manageClient = new ManageClient(apiKey);
```


## Customized & OnPrem Client Creation
>If you  need to customize the urlmset optional headers or change the deault HttpClient timeout then you can when creating  a client 
>passing in a instance of DeepgramClientOptions. 
```csharp
 var options = new DeepgramOptions()
    {
        BaseAddress  = "https://ScoobyDooDetectives.org"
    }
var manageClient = new ManageClient("apiKey",options);
```

### DeepgramClientOptions
| Property         | Value                       |          Description                   |
| --------         | :-----                      | :---------------------------:          |
| BaseAddress      | string?                     | url of server, include protocol        |
| Headers          | Dictionary<string, string>? | any headers that you want to add       |

>UserAgent & Authorization headers are added internally


# Examples

To quickly get started with examples for prerecorded and streaming, run the files in the example folder. See the README in that folder for more information on getting started.

# Transcription

## Remote File
> for available options see PrerecordedSchema
```csharp
var client = new PrerecordedClient(apiKey);
var response = await client.TranscribeUrlAsync(
    new UrlSource("https://static.deepgram.com/examples/Bueller-Life-moves-pretty-fast.wav"),
    new PrerecordedSchema()
    {
        Punctuate = true
    });
```

### UrlSource

| Property | Value  |          Description          |
| -------- | :----- | :---------------------------: |
| Url      | string | Url of the file to transcribe |

## Local files
>There are 2 overloads for local files you can pass either a byte[] or a stream 

```csharp
var client = new PrerecordedClient(apiKey);
var response = await client.TranscribeFileAsync(
    stream,
     new PrerecordedSchema()
    {
        Punctuate = true
    });
```

### CallBackAsync Methods
>TranscibeFileCallBackAsync and TranscibeUrlCallBackAsync are the methods to use if you want to use a CallBack url
>you can either pass the the CallBack in the method or by setting  the CallBack proeprty in the PrerecordedSchema, but NOT in both

## Live Audio

> The example below demonstrates sending a pre-recorded audio to simulate a real-time
> stream of audio. In a real application, this type of audio is better handled using the
> pre-recorded transcription.

```csharp
using Deepgram.CustomEventArgs;
using Deepgram.Models;
using System.Net.WebSockets;

var deepgramClient = new LiveClient(apiKey);

using (var deepgramLive = deepgramClient.CreateLiveTranscriptionClient())
{
    
    deepgramLive.EventResponseReceived += EventResponseReceived;

    // Connection opened so start sending audio.
    async void HandleConnectionOpened(object? sender, ConnectionOpenEventArgs e)
    {
        byte[] buffer;

        using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead("path\\to\\file"))
        {
            buffer = new byte[fs.Length];
            fs.Read(buffer, 0, (int)fs.Length);
        }

        var chunks = buffer.Chunk(1000);

        foreach (var chunk in chunks)
        {
            deepgramLive.Send(chunk);
            await Task.Delay(50);
        }
    }

    private async void HandleEventResponseReceived(object? sender, ResponseEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Response.Error is not null)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine(e.Response.Error.Message);
        } 
    }
        else if (e.Response.Transcription is not null)
    {
        var transcripts = response.Transcription.Channel.Alternatives
                .Where(a => a.Transcript.Length > 0);
        if (transcripts.Any())
        {
            await HandleTranscription(transcripts.ToList()).ConfigureAwait(false);
        }
    }

    var options = new LiveTranscriptionOptions() { Punctuate = true, Diarize = true, Encoding = Deepgram.Common.AudioEncoding.Linear16 };
    await deepgramLive.Connect(options);

    while (deepgramLive.State() == WebSocketState.Open) { }
}
```

# Logging

The Library uses Microsoft.Extensions.Logging to preform all of its logging tasks. To configure
logging for your app simply create a new `ILoggerFactory` and call the `LogProvider.SetLogFactory()`
method to tell the Deepgram library how to log. For example, to log to the console with Serilog, you'd need to install the Serilog package with `dotnet add package Serilog` and then do the following:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Deepgram.Logger;
using Serilog;

var log = new LoggerConfiguration()
    .MinimumLevel.Debug()
    .WriteTo.Console(outputTemplate: "{Timestamp:HH:mm} [{Level}]: {Message}\n")
    .CreateLogger();
var factory = new LoggerFactory();
factory.AddSerilog(log);
LogProvider.SetLogFactory(factory);
```
The sdk will generate loggers with the cateroryName of the client being used for example 
 to get the logger for the ManageClient you would call

```csharp
LogProvider.GetLogger(nameof(ManageClient));
```
